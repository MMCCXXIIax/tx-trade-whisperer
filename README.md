# TX – Trading Intelligence Platform (Beta Frontend Spec)

## 📌 Overview
**TX** is an AI‑powered trading intelligence assistant — not a financial advisor, broker, or fund manager.  
It delivers **real‑time pattern detection**, **educational explanations**, and **actionable entry/exit signals** across crypto, stocks, and forex — while keeping the user in full control of execution and funds.

**Tagline:** *"Your Intelligent Trading Co‑Pilot — Always in Your Hands."*

---

## 🚀 Core Mission
Equip traders with world‑class tools for:
- AI‑driven candlestick pattern recognition
- Real‑time market scanning
- Educational breakdowns of patterns and strategies
- Risk‑managed entry/exit signals
- Backtesting and paper trading
- Sentiment analysis from multiple sources

---

## 🏗 Architecture

**Frontend:** React + TypeScript (Vite) on port `5000`  
**Backend:** Python Flask + Socket.IO on port `8080`  
**Connection:**  
- Vite proxy routes `/api/*` → Flask backend  
- WebSocket for instant alerts: `ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/`
